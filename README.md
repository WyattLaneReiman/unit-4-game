# CRYSTALS COLLECTOR GAME! 

This game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a game where the goal is to choose between four crystals which are each assigned a number variable between 1 and 12, to hit the goal number displayed. 
When you start, you will be given a goal number between 19 and 120 that will be randomly generated for you after every Win, Loss, or sight refresh. 

Using the "crystal" buttons, which each hold a random number between 1-12, you will rack up your own score displayed below the buttons. If your score equals the randomly generated goal number, you will be alerted that you have won and your wins score will increase by 1. If you go over the goal number given, you will also be alerted but with a message stating you have lost the game, and your loss score will increase by 1. 
After you win or lose both the crystals themeselves, and the goal number will reset to a new random integer. 
This makes the game challenging as you have to re-evaluate your technique to hit the goal number every round.

The game has a few bugs. Occasionally, some of the crystals will generate the same number. 
The game does not reset your score until after you click on a crystal once you have won or lost. 

Why is this game useful? 
This game isn't necessarily useful for anything other than user enjoyment.. and because it is so simple it is not very enjoyable. It displays my abilities to incorporate JavaScript, HTML, and CSS together.
